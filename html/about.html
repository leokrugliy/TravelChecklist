    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
    Traveling is exciting — but packing? Not so much. <br>
    We’ve all had that moment when we arrive at the airport, train station, or campsite and realize we 
    forgot something important. That’s exactly why this little site exists. <br>  It’s a simple tool to help you create 
    a packing checklist in seconds — no logins, no annoying popups, no distractions. 
    Just pick your trip type (like flying, hiking, road trip, or traveling with kids), and we’ll give you a quick, 
    smart list of things you probably don’t want to forget. <br> The idea came from personal experience: I love traveling, 
    but I hate making packing 
    lists every time from scratch. So I made this tiny helper — for myself at first, and now it’s here for you too. <br> 
    This site will always be free and lightweight.
    If it helped you — feel free to share it with a fellow traveler. <br> Safe travels! 🌍✈️
